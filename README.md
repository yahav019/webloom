# Webloom - Complete Platform Specification

## Vision Statement

I aspire to develop a revolutionary, complete end-to-end platform that provides a comprehensive solution for the business development process - from the idea stage to the actual launch. The platform will not function as a point tool, but as a complete ecosystem that accompanies the user at every stage of the process - using smart AI technologies, strategic analysis, professional knowledge accessibility, and immediate action tools.

Users will be able to start from the planning and specification stage, where the platform will perform market analysis, help identify risks, and offer personalized branding and marketing strategy directions. Then, they can choose between two development tracks: independent development using a smart prompt set customized to the project characteristics - or professional development by the company team, for a fee, outside the platform.

Finally, at the launch stage, the platform will provide advanced tools for measuring success, content creation, digital marketing, SEO, generating quotes, and more. All this - while maintaining design consistency, professional user experience, and full multi-language support.

**The Goal:** To make accessible to every entrepreneur, business, or innovator the ability to take an idea and translate it into a real, professional, market-ready product - quickly, efficiently, and with complete confidence.

## Important Notes

**The system may sound complex, but in practice it's not at all. It's important to plan everything carefully and efficiently, then implement it while maintaining clear rules for API call management and function management, as well as managing the database effectively and efficiently in a way that matches the platform's purpose.**

**In general, API calls should be made in a way that provides the perfect average between accuracy and focus versus analysis cost. It should be noted that my platform is a business branch and therefore call management needs to be efficient.**

**You (Claude) will decide how to properly manage the project's database and API calls.**

### Main Development Tools:
- **Supabase as database**

### Build Stages (to prevent complexities):
1. **Basic settings and system setup with all necessary libraries**
