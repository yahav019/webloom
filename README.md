# Webloom - Complete Platform Specification
## Vision Statement
I aspire to develop a revolutionary, complete end-to-end platform that provides a comprehensive solution for the business development process - from the idea stage to the actual launch. The platform will not function as a point tool, but as a complete ecosystem that accompanies the user at every stage of the process - using smart AI technologies

**The Goal:** To make accessible to every entrepreneur, business, or innovator the ability to take an idea and translate it into a real, professional, market-ready product - quickly, efficiently, and with complete confidence.

## Setting Up a Smooth Workflow Between Supabase, GitHub, and the Local Dev Environment

Your first priority is to create a **seamless and efficient workspace** that connects Supabase, GitHub, and my local development environment.  
Automate repetitive actions by building scripts or commands that save time and prevent human error.  
Here’s a shortlist of essential scripts (maximum 10) you should implement:

1. **Deploy Function to Supabase** – Quickly push updated serverless functions to Supabase.  
2. **Create/Update Database Schema** – Generate or modify tables and apply schema changes instantly.  
3. **Seed Database** – Insert initial or test data with one command.  
4. **Run Local Supabase** – Spin up the Supabase environment locally for testing.  
5. **Sync Supabase with Production** – Pull the latest schema and data from production to local/dev.  
6. **Push Code to GitHub** – Stage, commit, and push changes with a single command.  
7. **Pull Code from GitHub** – Fetch and merge the latest updates from the repository.  
8. **Run Tests** – Trigger all automated tests before deployment.  
9. **Lint & Format Code** – Ensure code style consistency across the team.  
10. **Deploy Full Project** – One command to deploy both code and database changes.

The goal is to reduce manual steps, keep the workflow fast, and ensure consistency between local, staging, and production environments.

## Work Method: One Task, One Focus
From now on, every task you work on must have **one clear, central objective**.  
Avoid stacking multiple tasks together — splitting your attention leads to lower quality and slower progress.  
Your goal is to **complete each task to the highest possible standard** before moving on to the next.  

**Guidelines:**
1. **Define the main goal** of the task before you start.  
2. **Ignore unrelated work** until the current task is done.  
3. **Break large tasks** into smaller, standalone subtasks and handle them one by one.  
4. **Finish and test** each task to ensure it works perfectly.  
5. **Commit and document** changes before moving on.  
6. **Review your work** critically — aim for excellence, not “just done.”  
7. **Only start the next task** once the current one meets all acceptance criteria.  
8. **Use repeatable structures** — rely on reusable components, patterns, and templates to speed up development and maintain consistency.  
9. **Build on a solid foundation** — prepare a well-structured base of libraries, utilities, and configurations before starting complex features.  
10. **Leverage existing solutions** — don’t reinvent the wheel when proven, faster, and more reliable integrations or tools are available.

## API Key Security Requirements
Protecting API keys is **non-negotiable**.  
All keys must be stored **only** in a secure, dedicated location (such as environment variables in a protected `.env` file) and **never** committed to the repository.  
Ensure:
- Sensitive keys are kept outside the public codebase.  
- `.env` and similar files are included in `.gitignore`.  
- Access to keys is restricted only to trusted environments and authorized developers.  
- Keys are rotated periodically to reduce the risk of compromise.

Security is part of quality — a fast, functional feature is worthless if it leaves the system exposed.

## Important Notes
**Core Principles for Writing Fast, Secure, and Scalable Code**
When you write code, always think in terms of clarity, efficiency, security, and scalability.
Keep your logic modular — split features into small, reusable components so they can be maintained and extended without touching unrelated code. Avoid loading unnecessary data or libraries; only import what you need to keep performance high. Make sure your queries, loops, and DOM manipulations are optimized to avoid unnecessary overhead. Always validate and sanitize inputs both on the client and server to prevent vulnerabilities. Document your code with meaningful names and concise comments so anyone (including future you) can understand it quickly. Keep security in mind from the first line — no hard-coded secrets, protect against injection attacks, and manage permissions carefully. Finally, design with growth in mind: structure your project so that adding features won’t require rewriting the core. This approach ensures your code stays fast, secure, maintainable, and ready for scaling.

### Main Development Tools:
- **Supabase as database** - with CLI for auto funcion and edge function deploy and database scheme. 
- **Code editing in Github with Claude Code**

### Build Stages (to prevent complexities):
1. **Basic settings and system setup with all necessary libraries**
2. **Development of each tool (development + testing + fixes) separately**
3. **Building a functional dashboard screen for all developed tools (with automatic saving of outputs on real time, deletion capability,export capability, clear display of user area)**
4. **User authentication (saving user information, real-time updates)**- storng and smooth authentication flow
5. **Usage tracking according to user's subscription plan**



## Core Guidelines
1. **User-focused design** - Prioritize simplicity, clarity, and frictionless user experience
2. **Scalability** - Ensure the platform adapts to changing needs, from MVPs to full organizations
3. **Data-driven decision making** - Enable visualizations in almost every tool output to engage users

## Marketing Approach
Webloom will implement **AI-enhanced, text-focused marketing** to attract and convert users. The strategy focuses on  **powerful copy**, and **data-driven storytelling** throughout the platform. 
**Behavioral triggers**: Contextual messages that guide users at critical decision moments
